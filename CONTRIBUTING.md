# Contribute Guide

This document provides specific guidelines for contributing to this project. Please ensure you
follow the steps below to maintain consistency and quality. For general organizational rules, refer
to [profile/CONTRIBUTING.md](profile/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Note about cloning in Dev Container**: Because this repository's name begins with a dot
(`.github`), the VS Code Dev Containers feature "Clone repository in container volume" will not work
— Docker does not allow volume names that start with a dot. Use the "Clone repository in named
volume" option and choose a different volume name (for example: `ecoma-profile`) when opening this
repository in a Dev Container.
